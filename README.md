espacio comun For the past year I have been developing an economic system that can support the restoration of 150 chairs that will be placed on the balconies of a historic community call El Flansterio. I call this incentive Espacio Común. 

Espacio Común, in an effort to reach it’s goal, has ideated “Adopta una silla” – an economic system that supports the restoration of rescued chairs and the fabrication of new chairs based on the original design of the chairs and cushionings. The chairs that are being rescued are typical  designs that in the 50’s inhabited most balconies on the Island of Puerto Rico. These chairs currently risk becoming endangered, and are no longer produced. Espacio Común proposes and aspires to reproduce these chairs and make them available for purchase in large and small quantities. The ownership of this designed object and collectable piece represents your contribution towards collective action and community making. By buying a chair you would also be donating a chair to El Falansterio (a once vivid community that is now in derelict). The future and longer-term goal is that this action become contagious and spread to other communities fomenting out door spaces of common use.

These chairs are from the era of soft or light industrialization on the Island (between 1948 a 1965). The industrial enfasis of this era focuses on manual and local labor and production, such as in cloths, textiles, furniture y furniture made using iron rods. 

Many of the industrial spaces where these products were manufactured could be found in Puerta de Tierra, a sub-barrio of San Juan (capitol of Puerto Rico) where El Falansterio also sits.

The idea to rescue these chairs came about when a number of these chairs were noticed deteriorating in some of the balconies of El Falansterio. In a collective effort to rescue them, neighbors of El Falansterio have been donating these chairs to be resorted and ultimately placed back on their balconies in a unanimous effort to restore a sense and spirit of community that more accurately represents what it means to have lived in El Falansterio. 



  
Since the start of this project in early 2012 the residents have been handing in chairs for restoration. Up until now Espacio Común possesses 15 chairs of the 150 it muts obtain. The restoration process involves choosing paint, interpretation and elaboration of the original textiles for cushioning, welding and powdercoating of the chair, and upholstery of the cushions.   

Each resident chooses his or her own preferred textile and color of the chair. In the same manner, external supporters of this project or people “adopting a chair” choose their preferred textile, and style and color of the chair.

Espacio Común seeks support in any and all forms; e.g.: financial, design consultation, and strategic advice. Espacio Común invites designers and enthusiasts to visit the community and propose ideas inspired by the art deco fashion of the building complex. This invitation is part of Espacio Común’s mission to promote collaborative design. Up until now there 2 collections have been release, and can be looked at through the following link:
